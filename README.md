# Chip8pp
A C++ implementation of the Chip8 interpreter, using C++ and the SFML library.

## Building the game
Run make at the root of the project.
```bash
$ make
```

Alternatively, a set of Code::Blocks project files are provided, so it is possible to use Code::Blocks for development.

## Running a game
Run the program from the terminal, passing the path of a valid, original chip-8 game.

## Controls
1. Use the Return key to reset the game
2. Use the keys {1234, qwer, asdf, zxcv} as the buttons of the input keypad.
3. Use the Right and Left arrow keys to roughly increase or decrease the simulation speed.
